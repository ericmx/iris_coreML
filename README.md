# iris_coreML
An implementation of the Core ML framework using a linear regression model from sklearn and using the iris dataset. Obviously the iris dataset is not a linear regression, but currently classification is not supported. This model is largely based on the Apple provided Mars example, except implementing the iris dataset. 
I will also post how to actually integrate the model in Xcode (it's really easy) as well as export the model using Juypter Notebook.
